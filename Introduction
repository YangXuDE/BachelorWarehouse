The 13th University Students Energy-saving and Emission Reduction Social Practice and Technology Competition
March 2020 - December 2020
Project Leader, conducted topic research with teammates under the guidance of the tutor.

Topic Name: A Novel Water-saving Car Washing Platform Based on Visual SLAM
• Project Introduction: The car washing platform consists of a power system, a cleaning system, and a wastewater recycling system. It utilizes a support beam rotating around the base and a mechanical arm equipped with a water spray device. The binocular camera and SLAM algorithm are used to recognize the vehicle target depth, automatically plan the car washing path, and complete the car washing process. The base device consists of four water tanks embedded with a wastewater recycling system, which can realize the recycling of car washing wastewater, meeting the requirements of household car washing and the layout of the sharing economy. It is fully automatic, mobile, water-saving, time-saving, and has high cleaning efficiency, opening up new directions for the future car washing industry.
• Innovation Points of the Project:
1. Research on fine car washing based on visual SLAM and mechanical spray head arm.
2. Self-circulating layout design of the wastewater recycling device for the miniaturized car washing platform.
3. Theoretical research on the application of small shared car washing platforms covering communities.
• Project Results: Applied for research funding of more than 4,000 RMB, won the second prize in the provincial competition.
